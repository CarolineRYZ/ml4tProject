Also, the following files can be run separately using the command lines below:

To run indicators.py: PYTHONPATH=../. python indicators.py 
To run ManualStrategy.py: PYTHONPATH=../. python ManualStrategy.py
To run experiment1: PYTHONPATH=../. python experiment1.py
To run experiment2: PYTHONPATH=../. python experiment2.py
